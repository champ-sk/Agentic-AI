The user asked for Mukesh Ambani's net worth and then to divide it by 2. First, I need to figure out his current net worth. The search results mention different figures: $108 billion, $119.5 billion, $97 billion. Hmm, there's some variation here. The dates mentioned are up to 2025, but the user's query is in 2024. Wait, the latest info from October 2024 says $119.5 billion. But another entry from June 2025 says $97 billion. That's conflicting.\\n\\nI need to check which one is more recent. The October 2024 entry mentions $119.5 billion, and then a June 2025 entry says $97 billion. Wait, June 2025 is after October 2024, so maybe the $97 billion is the more recent figure. But that seems lower, which is odd. Maybe there was a market fluctuation or a different source. The user might want the most up-to-date number. However, the sources aren't clear. Since the user asked as of 2024, maybe the $119.5 billion from October 2024 is the correct one. Alternatively, the June 2025 figure could be a typo or a different estimation method.\\n\\nAssuming the highest figure is the most accurate, $119.5 billion. Then divide that by 2. Let me confirm the arithmetic. 119.5 divided by 2 is 59.75. So the result would be $59.75 billion. But I need to make sure which number to use. Since there's inconsistency in the sources, I should note that there's variation in the reported net worth. However, using the most recent mention from June 2025 of $97 billion, dividing by 2 gives $48.5 billion. Wait, but the user's context is 2024. The June 2025 figure might be from a future date, which isn't applicable. So perhaps the correct figure is $119.5 billion as of October 2024. Therefore, dividing that by 2 gives $59.75 billion. I should present both possibilities but go with the most relevant date.\\n\"}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 611, 'prompt_tokens': 946, 'total_tokens': 1557, 'completion_time': 1.352172481, 'prompt_time': 0.034225319, 'queue_time': 0.049828121, 'total_time': 1.3863978000000001, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 512}}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--29da6b57-702b-4dee-9b33-3d7b32737e97-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 946, 'output_tokens': 611, 'total_tokens': 1557})]}"

Let\\'s say the search returns a distance of 100 kilometers (this is an example; the actual distance might be different). The next step is to multiply this distance by 10. For the multiplication, I can use the multiply function. The parameters here would be a=100 and b=10. \\n\\nWait, but I need to make sure that the distance is correctly retrieved first. So the process is: first perform the search to get the distance, then take that result and multiply by 10. Since the user wants the final answer, I need to execute these two steps in sequence. \\n\\nI should check if the search function will give me the exact distance. Sometimes, search results might mention different routes or modes of transport, so I need to find the most accurate or commonly cited distance.
